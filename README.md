# Invoice Management System

This project is an **enhanced version** of an existing [Invoice Generator](https://github.com/johnuberbacher/invoice-generator). The original project only supported generating an invoice from provided details in a single form. This version expands on that by introducing **Invoice Management** and a **Products Tab** for better organization.

## Features

### âœ… Originally Supported Features
- Generate an invoice by entering all details in a single form.
- Export the invoice as a document.

### ðŸ”„ New Enhancements
- **Invoices can now be saved and managed** â€“ View, edit, and delete invoices instead of just generating them.

- **Dedicated Products Tab** â€“ Products are now managed separately from invoices.
  - Add, edit, or remove product items independently.
  - Group products into categories for better organization.

- **Two-Tab Invoice Layout:**
  - **Overview Tab** â€“ Displays invoice details like client info and tax rates.
  - **Products Tab** â€“ Lists and manages associated product items.

- **Duplicate Existing Invoices** â€“ Quickly create a new invoice based on an existing one.

- **Shared Product Updates** â€“
  - If a product's name or description is updated, it reflects across all invoices using that product.
  - Changing a productâ€™s quantity only affects that specific invoice, not others.
